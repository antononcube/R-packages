"Running Raku code can be done using the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). To do this, open a terminal, type raku into the terminal window, and hit [Enter]. This will cause a prompt of > to appear. Next, type a line of code and hit [Enter]. The REPL will print out the value of the line. You may then type another line, or type exit and hit [Enter] to leave the REPL.

Alternatively, write your code in a file, save it and run it. It is recommended that Raku scripts have a .raku file name extension. Run the file by typing raku filename.raku into the terminal window and hitting [Enter]. Unlike the REPL, this will not automatically print the result of each line: the code must contain a statement like say to print output.

The REPL is mostly used for trying a specific piece of code, typically a single line. For programs with more than a single line it is recommended to store them in a file and then run them.

Single lines may also be tried non-interactively on the command-line by typing raku -e 'your code here' and hitting [Enter]."

Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла,[2] pronounced [nǐkola têsla];[a] 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American[5][6][7] inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.[8]
Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.

  # strip unused characters but leave ' and -
  # s <- gsub("[^[:alpha:][:space:]'-]", " ", s)
  
  # now let's get rid of single quotes that are quoted strings and not in the middle of a word
  # this will leave contractions like don't, I'm, etc.
  s <- gsub("(?<!\\w)[-'](?<!\\w)" , " ", s, perl=TRUE) # just leave - and ' in the middle of words
  
  s <- gsub("[[:space:]]+", " ", s, perl=TRUE) # consolidate spaces

## First tries
