Description: The package named, HIRMon-R, stands for "Hub-Item Recommender Monad in R."
    HIRMon imlements the Hub-Item Dynamic Ranking Algorithm (HIDRA). 
    HIDRA can be seen as an extension of PageRank. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank .
    The difference is that HIDRA works on a bi-partite graph and
    multiple rank vectors are calculated using different biasing based on  
    predicates over the nodes. For a particular query a linear
    combination of the closest ranks vectors is used in order to obtain
    the response ranks. (That is the dynamic ranking part.)
    There are at least two other similar algorithms:
    1. Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS), http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm
    2. Topic-Sensitive PageRank, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic-Sensitive_PageRank
