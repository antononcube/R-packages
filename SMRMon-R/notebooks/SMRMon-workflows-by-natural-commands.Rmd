# Introduction

This notebooks demonstrates the construction of recommender workflows
using natural language commands.

# Creation

Simple creation:

```{r}
smrObj <-
  SMRMonUnit( data = dfTitanic ) %>%
  SMRMonCreate( itemColumnName = "id")
```

# Basic pipeline

```{r}
dfTitanic
```

```{r}
smrObj2 <-
  eval( expr = to_SMRMon_R_command( 
    "create from dfTitanic; 
     recommend for history id.5, id.7; 
     join across recommendations with the data frame dfTitanic; 
     echo pipeline value" ) )
```

```{r}
smrObj2 <- 
  eval( to_SMRMon_R_command( 
    "use recommender smrObj2; 
     recommend for the history id.5, id.7; 
     echo value" ) )
```

## By profile

```{r}
to_SMRMon_R_command("recommend by profile female, died")
```

```{r}
smrObj2 <-
  SMRMonUnit() %>% 
  eval( expr = to_SMRMon_R_command( 
    "create from dfTitanic; 
     recommend by profile female, 30; 
     extend recommendations with dfTitanic; 
     show pipeline value" ) )
```
