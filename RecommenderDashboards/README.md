# Shiny interfaces

## Introduction

This repository has code and data for different interactive interfaces made with 
[RStudio's Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com).

## Installation

First install the R packages in the script: 
[CRAN-and-GitHub-installation.R](https://bitbucket.org/connectedentsearch/shinyinterfaces/src/master/R/CRAN-and-GitHub-installation.R).

(Open that file in RStudio and run it. Alternatively, using a command line tool run it with `Rscript`.)

## The example interface

The example interface is "ready to go" -- just open the file 
[GenericRecommenderInterface.Rmd](https://bitbucket.org/connectedentsearch/shinyinterfaces/src/master/flexdashboards/GenericRecommenderInterface.Rmd)
in RStudio and run it. (By pressing the button "Run Document".)
